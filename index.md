### Olá 👋🏾

I'm Isabel, a software developer from Portugal. I work at [Grupo Impresa](http://impresa.pt). 

I'm one of the maintainers of Mentorship System project, within Systers Open Source community.

I blog sometimes on [Medium](https://medium.com/@isabelcmdcosta). Last summer I participated on the Google Summer of Code program, where I documented everything about my journey on [Isabel Costa GSoC medium publication](https://medium.com/isabel-costa-gsoc).

Sometimes
