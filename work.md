## üöß Projects

### Mentorship System

This is a project I proposed for Google Summer of Code program that I participated on 2018.

This summer I was a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) Student with [Systers Community](https://github.com/systers). I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/), a mentorship application to help women in tech mentor each other, on career development topics, during a certain period of time. I worked with mentors, the Systers Open Source community.

I started with the Backend REST API development, using python and flask. After 2 months designing and implementing the backend I started implementing the Android application with Kotlin.

Repositories on GitHub:
- Backend application: [systers/mentorship-backend](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend);
- Android application: [systers/mentorship-android](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-android).

I documented my journey with 1 blog per week on [Isabel Costa GSoC Medium publication](https://medium.com/isabel-costa-gsoc). 

### Personal Website

Usually, I use Jekyll based websites, to facilitate the development through using Markdown files and without having to do much frontend work. I'm using [jekyll/minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template on this website.

These are the different versions of my websites until this current one:
- **1st version:** [Live](http://isabelcosta.github.io/personal-website-first-version) and on [GitHub](http://github.com/isabelcosta/personal-website-first-version);
- **2nd version:** [Live](http://isabelcosta.github.io/personal-website-second-version) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/isabelcosta/personal-website-second-version);
- **3rd version:** this website right here :) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/isabelcosta/isabelcosta.github.io).
