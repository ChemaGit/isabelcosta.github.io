## üöß Projects

### Mentorship System

This is a project I proposed for Google Summer of Code program that I participated on 2018.

This summer I was a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) Student with [Systers Community](https://github.com/systers). I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5331289322815488), a mentorship application to help women in tech mentor each other, on career development topics, during a certain period of time. I worked with mentors, the Systers Open Source community.

I started with the Backend REST API development, using python and flask. After 2 months designing and implementing the backend I started implementing the Android application with Kotlin.

Repositories on GitHub:
- Backend application: [systers/mentorship-backend](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend);
- Android application: [systers/mentorship-android](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-android).

I documented my journey with 1 blog per week on [Isabel Costa GSoC Medium publication](https://medium.com/isabel-costa-gsoc).
