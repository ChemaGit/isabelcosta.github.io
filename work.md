## üöß Projects

### Mentorship System

This is a project I proposed for Google Summer of Code program that I participated on 2018.

This summer I was a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) Student with [Systers Community](https://github.com/systers). I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5331289322815488), which I started implementing the [backend](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend) and [android application](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-android) during the program.

### Personal Website

Usually I use Jekyll websites. Because I like to to see evolution, here is a history of my websites:
- 1¬∫ version [Live](http://isabelcosta.github.io/personal-website-first-version) and on [GitHub](http://github.com/isabelcosta/personal-website-first-version)
