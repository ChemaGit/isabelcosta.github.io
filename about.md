### Hello üëãüèæ

I'm Isabel, a software developer from Portugal.

I‚Äôm really interested in the Android ecosystem and working with mobile applications. I‚Äôm mostly used to programming with Java, Kotlin and python. I always try to be open to learning new languages and frameworks depending on the need of the project. I thrive to learn about software development best practices and apply them to my work.

I find very interesting participating in projects since its very beginning to end and seeing it culminate in a final product while contributing in every aspect of it. Fortunately, I was able to do that during Google Summer of Code program.

I aspire to be happy!

### üåÖ Open Source

After participating on [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) 2018's edition with [Systers Community](http://systers.io) I started to really like **Open Source**. At the moment, I‚Äôm a maintainer of the project that I proposed, [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5331289322815488).

What I‚Äôve been enjoying the most about being a maintainer is to manage the project contributions and, at the same time, help newcomers making their first contribution to open source, while providing a safe environment for them to learn, with the help from the community.

### üéì Education

I‚Äôve graduated from Bachelors (2015) and Masters degree (2018) of **Telecommunication and Informatics Engineering** at [T√©cnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). I‚Äôve developed my Master's thesis [_Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware_](https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium) at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), which combines multipath communication and route monitoring to react to hijacking attacks.

### üíº Work

I'm currently working as a Software Developer at [Grupo Impresa](http://www.impresa.pt/), a Portuguese group of media products.

During my master degree, I‚Äôve worked as an Android developer for 2+ years in a consulting agency, [INM](https://inm.pt/).

On my third year in college, I interned at a startup, [Uniplaces](https://uniplaces.com/), where I contributed mostly to their web platform.
